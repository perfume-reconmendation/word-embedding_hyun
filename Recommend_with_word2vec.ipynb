It never dries, not even hours of wearing. Water ivy and fantastic turquoise birds discovered in the pharaons tombs are its coulours.

I see a blonde girl of Britney Spears type in a candy-pink, fluffy cashmere sweater while it's snowing all around and while gingerbread is getting ready in the oven. In time (after half an hour) the scent becomes less sweet and more mature and indeed some spicy/aromatic notes emerge - but not quite rum - rather cupboard filled with spices. The scent is rich and long-lasting, and the longer you wear it, the better - screechy notes disappear in time and the spicy background becomes warmer with every minute. I believe it might be cool for a family reunion dinner on a cold winter evening.
