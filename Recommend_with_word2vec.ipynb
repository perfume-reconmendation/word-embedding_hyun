The light splash of an aquatic creature. The sun reflected into the crystaline waves and bloom of the nufars. All the luxury of the water and its lush offspring in a scent that retains the so called \"aquatic notes\" in an authentic and unfading way, like none other perfume can do. \r\n","Un Jardin sur le Nile is the ultimate expression of aquatic lust. It's power is so strong, that it not only brings the honeyed yet fresh scent of aquatic flowers, but also the flowing, dropping noises made by the water and the muted float that one gets while diving.\r\n","From the citronade sipped in an elegant cocktail glass near a palm shaded and mint and jasmine scented swimming pool in Cairo, to the deep and dark green of the ancient Egyptian sacred pool in Karnak, Le Jardin renders a continuos wave of misterious water delight. It never dries, not even hours of wearing. Water ivy and fantastic turquoise birds discovered in the pharaons tombs are its coulours. Green is not enough green for it, water is not enough wet for it to describe, lemon and orange are not enough as the cause of its freshness. Just wear it and be transported sur le Nil.\n","\n","\n","Top 3\n","향수 명:  Wood Sage & Sea Salt Jo Malone London for women and men\n","유사도:  0.9068034541425192\n","리뷰:  This perfume smells like the East Coast Surfing Championships I used to go and watch!

Sweet cherry flavored coke with a hint of tobacco and incense. It’s gourmand but very grownup, not like the dessert-y blue sugar kind of tobacco gourmand.

I see a blonde girl of Britney Spears type in a candy-pink, fluffy cashmere sweater while it's snowing all around and while gingerbread is getting ready in the oven. In time (after half an hour) the scent becomes less sweet and more mature and indeed some spicy/aromatic notes emerge - but not quite rum - rather cupboard filled with spices. The scent is rich and long-lasting, and the longer you wear it, the better - screechy notes disappear in time and the spicy background becomes warmer with every minute. I believe it might be cool for a family reunion dinner on a cold winter evening.
